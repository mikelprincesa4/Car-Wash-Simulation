# Car-Wash-Simulation
Runs a simulation of a full work day(8 hours) of Ethan's Car Wash.
For each minute a shift the program is to:
  -queue customers when they arrive as long as there are less than 4 in line
  -if there are more then 4 cars in line the next car will leave
  -determine service time for current customer (2-5 minutes)
  -calulate wait time for other customers in line
  -calculate the completion time and record information
At the end of a shift the program is to:
  -calculate total customers served
  -calculate number of minutes thtat the car wash was idle
  -average wait time in minutes
  -longest wait time in minutues
  -record number of customers that bypassed the car wash
Program created in collaboration with partner David Hass for Linear Data Structures Course.
